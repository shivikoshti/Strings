# Strings
## Theory 
A string in C++ is a sequence of characters, commonly used to represent text. It is a fundamental data type with operations like concatenation and length calculation, making it essential for handling textual data efficiently in C++ programs.<br>
## Syntax 
string myString = "Hello, World!";<br>
## Features
String Length: You can get the length of a string object by using a 'size()' function or a 'length()' function.
String Concatenation: Use the '+' operator to concatenate strings and create a new string.
Palindrome Detection: Check if a string is a palindrome (i.e., the reverse of the string is the same as the original).
